## Service microservice

<!-- Explain your models and integration with the inventory
microservice, here. -->


## Sales microservice

- Created an `AutomobileVO` and used poller to be able to communicate to the Inventory Microservice.

- Created three other models, `Salesperson`, `PotentialCustomer`, and `SalesRecord` with required properties so we could create, update, get a list of all, get specified details of one, or delete an instance from said models using views and encoders.
